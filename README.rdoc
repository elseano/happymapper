= happymapper

== DESCRIPTION:

XML to object mapping library. I have included examples to help get you going. The specs should also point you in the right direction.

This is a custom version of HappyMapper, available there:
http://github.com/dam5s/happymapper/

== FEATURES:

* Easy to define xml attributes and elements for an object
* Fast because it uses nokogiri under the hood
* Automatic conversion of xml to defined objects
* Reusable classes via a node finding mechanism that searches by 1. specified tag,
2. name of element, 3. class name. (gemspec was upgraded to 0.3.0 for this change)

== EXAMPLES:

Here is a simple example that maps Twitter statuses and users.
  require 'happymapper'

  class User
    include HappyMapper

    element :id, Integer
    element :name, String
    element :screen_name, String
    element :location, String
    element :description, String
    element :profile_image_url, String
    element :url, String
    element :protected, Boolean
    element :followers_count, Integer
  end

  class Status
    include HappyMapper

    element :id, Integer
    element :text, String
    element :created_at, Time
    element :source, String
    element :truncated, Boolean
    element :in_reply_to_status_id, Integer
    element :in_reply_to_user_id, Integer
    element :favorited, Boolean
    has_one :user, User
  end

See examples directory in the gem for more examples.
